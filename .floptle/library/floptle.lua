---@meta
--- Floptle engine scripting API (ADR-0003). Generated — do not edit.

---@class Node The node's transform, synced to/from the engine each frame.
---@field x number World X position.
---@field y number World Y position.
---@field z number World Z position.
---@field scale number Uniform scale (shortcut; sets all axes).
---@field scale_x number Scale along X.
---@field scale_y number Scale along Y.
---@field scale_z number Scale along Z.
---@field yaw number Heading about Y, in radians.
---@field pitch number Pitch about X, in radians.
---@field roll number Roll about Z, in radians.
---@field grounded boolean Physics (rigidbody nodes): resting on a surface this frame.
---@field vx number Physics: body velocity X (read/write — set it to drive the body).
---@field vy number Physics: body velocity Y (read/write).
---@field vz number Physics: body velocity Z (read/write).
---@field up_x number Physics: body up (−gravity) X — radial on a planet.
---@field up_y number Physics: body up (−gravity) Y.
---@field up_z number Physics: body up (−gravity) Z.
---@field visible boolean Show / hide this node's geometry (Inspector eye toggle).
---@field persistent boolean Carry this node — and everything under it — across a `scene.load` swap. Its scripts keep RUNNING (`start` does not re-fire), because the node never stopped existing.
---@field pos Vec3 The node's position as a vec3 (read/write: `node.pos = node.pos + dir * dt`). Accepts any {x=,y=,z=} value.
---@field vel Vec3 The body's velocity as a vec3 (read/write) — one write instead of vx/vy/vz: `node.vel = node.vel + node.up * jump`.
---@field up Vec3 The body's up as a vec3 (−gravity): Y on flat ground, RADIAL on a planet. The direction to jump in wherever you're standing.
---@field groundNormal Vec3|nil The floor the body stands on (read-only) — nil while airborne. `groundNormal:dot(node.up)` is the cosine of the slope.
---@field wallNormal Vec3|nil The steepest surface the body is pressed against (read-only), or nil when there's only floor. Stop pushing into it and a walk into a cliff stops launching you into the sky.
---@field forward Vec3 The node's facing as a vec3, from its rotation (−Z forward, like the camera). Works on anything with a transform.
---@field right Vec3 The node's +X axis as a vec3. Pairs with `forward` for camera-relative movement.
---@field size Vec3 The whole scale as a vec3 (read/write). `node.scale` stays the uniform shortcut and also accepts a vec3.
---@field tickX number Physics: the BODY's world X at the start of this tick. Not node.x — that's the INTERPOLATED render pose between ticks, so reading it in fixedUpdate is frame-rate dependent and no rollback replay can reproduce it. Writing this teleports the body without touching the transform.
---@field tickY number Physics: the body's world Y at the start of this tick (read/write).
---@field tickZ number Physics: the body's world Z at the start of this tick (read/write).
---@field tickPos Vec3 Physics: the body's tick pose as a vec3 (read/write). Build hurtboxes from THIS, and move a fighter with `node.tickPos = node.tickPos + vec3(d, 0, 0)` — `node.x = node.x + d` inside fixedUpdate teleports the body onto its VISUAL position, so the model slides and the hitbox doesn't.
---@field layer string Collision/query layer, by project-defined NAME ("Default" when unset). Assigning a name the project doesn't define is an ERROR — add layers in Project Settings.
---@field tags string[] The node's tags (a fresh array each read). Assign a whole array to replace; use addTag/removeTag for single edits.
---@field hasTag fun(self: Node, tag: string): boolean Whether the node carries this exact tag.
---@field destroy fun(self: Node) Remove this node and its whole subtree (queued; applied after the pass). Same as `destroy(node)`.
---@field addTag fun(self: Node, tag: string) Add a tag (duplicates are ignored).
---@field removeTag fun(self: Node, tag: string) Remove a tag (no-op when absent).
---@field height number Physics (capsule bodies): standing height - write a smaller value to crouch.
---@field text string|nil UI elements: the label's text (write to change it — numbers coerce, so `hp.text = 42` works).
---@field getcomponent fun(self: Node, name: string): RigidBodyHandle|PointLightHandle|LightHandle|CameraHandle|UiElementHandle|UiSliderHandle|UiLayerHandle|MaterialHandle|nil Live component handle (RigidBody / PointLight / Light / Camera / ParticleSystem / AudioSource / UiElement / UiSlider / UiLayer / Material), nil if the node lacks it.
---@field particles fun(self: Node): ParticleSystemHandle The particle handle for this node's Particle System: play / stop / restart the effect and read its live state.
---@field setShaderParam fun(self: Node, name: string, x: number, y?: number, z?: number, w?: number) Drive a `.flsl` uniform on this node every tick (a GPU uniform write, never a recompile): the node's Material shader, or its UI element's `stage ui` shader (instruments like the navball). Unset lanes are 0.
---@field setCelestial fun(self: Node, t: table) Construction API: set (and create if absent) the node's CelestialBody. Fields (camelCase): mu, bodyRadius, soi, parent (name string), a, e, i, lan, argPe, m0, atmoColor {r,g,b}, atmoHeight, atmoDensity, clouds, luminosity, starColor, occluderRadius (occlusion culling: radius of the solid core geometry never pierces — chunks fully behind it skip their draws; keep it BELOW the deepest cave/dig; 0 = off).
---@field setShaderTexture fun(self: Node, slot: string, ref: string) Point one of this node's `.flsl` shader texture SLOTS somewhere else, at runtime. `slot` is the name the shader declares (`texture ramp` gives "ramp"); `ref` is a project-relative image path, an `rt:<name>` render target (what another camera sees, live), or "" to clear the slot. A shader can declare up to 8 slots.
---@field setMaterial fun(self: Node, t: table) Construction API — SETUP-TIME, not per-frame: set (and create if absent) the node's Material. It inserts the component and queues a deferred write, so call it on transitions and use `setShaderParam` for values that change every tick. Fields: color/emissive/specular/rim (a colour takes {r,g,b}, {x,y,z}, {1,0.5,0.2} or vec3), emissiveStrength, shininess, specularStrength, rimStrength, unlit (bool), ambient, alpha, texture (path or "rt:<name>"), sheetCols/sheetRows/cell (spritesheet grid + which cell draws — `cell` is also a live mirror field, see MaterialHandle).
---@field setTerrain fun(self: Node, id: number) Construction API: make this node a Terrain volume with the given id (generate its field with `terrain.generatePlanet`).
---@field setTerrainGen fun(self: Node, opts: table|nil) Construction API: attach an ON-DEMAND generation spec (same opts table as `terrain.generatePlanet`) — the body's field generates in the background when first approached, so no field file is needed at all (galaxy streaming). Player edits saved under `terrain.saveDir` take priority over regeneration. nil clears the spec.
---@field setPrimitive fun(self: Node, shape: string, color?: table) Construction API: make this node a primitive ("Cube"/"Sphere"/"Capsule"/"Plane") with an optional {r,g,b} color.
---@field setCamera fun(self: Node, t: table) Construction API: aim a camera and point it at a RENDER TARGET. Fields: fovY (RADIANS, 0.05–3), active (bool — true clears every other camera's authority), target (a bare name; the picture is the texture "rt:<name>", usable on any material or UI image), width/height (the target's pixels, 8–4096), hz (redraws per second, 0 = every frame), cullMask (layer bitmask). A node that is not a camera becomes one. Minimaps, mirrors, security monitors, scopes, split-screen.
---@field sound fun(self: Node): AudioSourceHandle The sound handle for this node's Audio Source: play / stop / pause / swap clips and read playback state.
---@field parent Node|nil The parent node handle, or nil at the root.
---@field getparent fun(self: Node): Node|nil The parent node handle, or nil (same as node.parent).
---@field children fun(self: Node): Node[] An array of this node's child handles.
---@field getchild fun(self: Node, name: string): Node|nil The first CHILD with that name, or nil.
---@field child fun(self: Node, name: string): Node|nil Short alias of getchild.
---@field find fun(self: Node, name: string): Node|nil The first DESCENDANT at any depth with that name, or nil. getchild only looks one level down.
---@field getscript fun(self: Node, name: string): table|nil A script handle for that script on this node, or nil: read/write its state, call its methods, reach .node / .params.
---@field script fun(self: Node, name: string): table|nil Short alias of getscript.
---@field component fun(self: Node, name: string): RigidBodyHandle|PointLightHandle|LightHandle|CameraHandle|UiElementHandle|UiSliderHandle|UiLayerHandle|MaterialHandle|nil Short alias of getcomponent.
---@field animator fun(self: Node): table The animation handle for this node's Animation Controller (or a rigged model's embedded clips): :play / :restart / :crossfade / :stop / :setSpeed / :setLayerWeight / :seek, and :state / :time / :finished / :isPlaying.
---@field toWorld fun(self: Node, v: Vec3): Vec3 A point in this node's own frame converted to world space — position, rotation AND scale, composed up the whole parent chain. "Where is the muzzle?" is gun:toWorld(vec3(0, 0, -1.2)).
---@field toLocal fun(self: Node, v: Vec3): Vec3 The inverse of toWorld: a world point expressed in this node's frame.
---@field setWorldPos fun(self: Node, v: Vec3) Put this node at a WORLD point, whatever it is parented to, without deriving the parent inverse by hand.
---@field worldForward fun(self: Node): Vec3 The node's forward AFTER the parent chain. node.forward is the LOCAL one, so a barrel parented to a swinging arm points where the ARM says.
---@field worldRight fun(self: Node): Vec3 The node's +X axis after the parent chain.
---@field worldUp fun(self: Node): Vec3 The node's +Y axis after the parent chain (not node.up, which is the body's -gravity up).
---@field distanceTo fun(self: Node, other: Node|Vec3): number Distance to a node or a world point, measured in WORLD space. distance(a, b) compares LOCAL positions, which stops being the same answer the moment one of the two is parented.
---@field distanceFlat fun(self: Node, other: Node|Vec3, up?: Vec3): number Distance ignoring the up axis (default +Y): the "have I arrived?" test for anything walking on ground it does not control the height of. Pass an up for a planet.
---@field lookAt fun(self: Node, target: Node|Vec3, up?: Vec3) Point this node at another node or a world point. Sets yaw + pitch and leaves roll alone; pass an up and it sets roll too.
---@field turnTowards fun(self: Node, target: Node|Vec3, maxRadians: number) Turn toward something by at most that much, the SHORT way round. Pass rate * dt for a frame-rate-independent turn.
---@field moveTowards fun(self: Node, target: Node|Vec3, maxDelta: number) The method spelling of moveTowards(node, ...). World-space and placed through the parent inverse, so a node under a container arrives where you pointed.
---@field setTint fun(self: Node, color?: Color, alpha?: number) A colour MULTIPLIED over everything this node draws — its own textures and each part's own colour are kept. The easy "same model, but red": a hit flash, a team colour, a ghosted preview. `node:setTint()` with nothing clears it. Different from a Material, which REPLACES the model's own materials.
---@field material fun(self: Node, name?: string): MaterialHandle Read and change a material with code. With no name: this node's own Material, which on a MODEL covers every part of it. With a name from `node:materials()` — an object like `Torso#2` or a material like `Clothing` — just that part of the model, creating the override on first write.
---@field materials fun(self: Node): ModelSlot[] What this model's parts are CALLED, so a script can address one: `{object=, material=, textured=, overridden=}` per slot. Empty on a node that is not an imported model.
---@field sprite fun(self: Node): SpriteHandle Read and change how this ONE sprite draws: `node:sprite().flipX = true`. Fields: flipX, flipY, cell, ppu, size, pivotX, pivotY — each readable and assignable. Raises on a node that is not a Sprite (a batch node wants node:sprites(), plural).
---@field setSprite fun(self: Node, t: table) Construction API: make this node one SPRITE, or retune one. Keys (all optional, each keeping what the node had): ppu, size, cell, flipX, flipY, pivotX, pivotY. ppu is pixels per unit measured against ONE CELL of the Material's sheet; ppu=0 falls back to size, a world edge length. pivotY=0 puts the origin at the sprite's feet, which is what a Y-sorted character wants.
---@field setSpriteBatch fun(self: Node, t?: table) Construction API: make this node a SPRITE BATCH, so node:sprites() can draw into it. Key: size (the world edge length one sprite gets before its own scale).
---@field sprites fun(self: Node): table A handle to this node's SpriteBatch (make it one with setSpriteBatch first): b:draw(...) queues one sprite for this frame, each with its own position, rotation, scale, cell and tint.
---@field setTilemap fun(self: Node, t: table) Construction API: make this node a TILEMAP — a grid of spritesheet cells drawn as one mesh. Keys: cols, rows, tile, data, tileset.
---@field tilemap fun(self: Node): TilemapHandle A handle to this node's tilemap grid: tm:set / tm:get / tm:at / tm:fill / tm:fillRect / tm:size / tm:resize, and tm:cellAt / tm:worldAt / tm:tileSize in world space.
---@field setSorting fun(self: Node, t: table) Where this 2D node draws in the stack. Keys (both optional): layer, one of the project's sorting layers by NAME, and order, higher being nearer the camera.
---@field sorting fun(self: Node): table Where this node sits in the 2D stack: { layer =, order =, mode = }. A node that has never said anything about sorting answers with the DEFAULT rather than nil, because that IS where it draws.
---@field getsorting fun(self: Node): table Short alias of sorting.
---@field setParallax fun(self: Node, t: table) How much of the camera's movement this layer KEEPS, per axis: x and y. 1 moves with the world (the default), 0 pins it to the camera as if infinitely far away.
---@field setCamera2D fun(self: Node, t: table) How this ORTHOGRAPHIC camera follows. Keys (all optional, each per axis): follow, smoothing, deadZoneX, deadZoneY, limits, minX, minY, maxX, maxY, pixelSnap, off. pixelSnap is pixels per world unit and lands the DRAWN camera on a whole pixel of that grid (0 = off), which is what stops pixel art shimmering when the camera stops between two. Dead zone, then smoothing, then limits. Does nothing on anything that is not an orthographic camera.
---@field shake fun(self: Node, amount: number, seconds?: number) Shake a 2D camera: amount is a distance in world units, seconds defaults to 0.3, and it fades out. Added to what is DRAWN and never fed back into the follow. Calling it again takes the LOUDER amplitude and the LONGER time, each independently.
---@field setLighting2D fun(self: Node, t: table) 2D lighting, from a script. Keys: mode (auto/2d/3d), layers (the sorting layers a light reaches), blocks (auto/on/off, whether a receiver occludes), inner, falloff, shadows.
---@field setPointLight fun(self: Node, t: table) Construction API: make this node a light, or retune one. Keys (all optional, each keeping what the node had, INCLUDING its emitter shape): color, intensity, range.
---@field setScreenShader fun(self: Node, name: string, on: boolean) Switch one of the Post Processing node's screen shaders on or off. The name is the file without its extension, the one the Inspector lists.
---@field uiRect fun(self: Node): number, number, number, number Where this UI element was actually laid out on screen this frame — x, y, w, h in pixels — or nil if it is not a UI element or has not been drawn yet.

---A Rigidbody's live tunables (every Inspector field). Assign to change while playing;
---booleans may be written true/false and read back as 1/0.
---@class RigidBodyHandle
---@field friction number Grip, as a coefficient: a ramp holds while tan(its angle) <= friction. 0 is ice, 1 holds exactly 45 degrees, above 1 is grippier still.
---@field slopeLimit number Steepest standable surface, in degrees (default 60). Past it nothing grounds the body and no grip holds it.
---@field restitution number Bounciness 0..1 (0 = no bounce).
---@field gravity number Gravity pull on this body (1/0; assign true/false).
---@field kinematic number Transform-driven mode (1/0; assign true/false, live): never falls or gets pushed, but PUSHES dynamic bodies — platforms, elevators, grabbed objects. (Static mode is the Inspector dropdown — a baked collider, nothing to toggle here.)
---@field shape number Body shape: 0 = sphere, 1 = capsule, 2 = box.
---@field radius number Sphere/capsule radius.
---@field height number Capsule total height.
---@field half_x number Box half-extent X.
---@field half_y number Box half-extent Y.

---@field lock_z number Freeze world Z translation (1/0).
---@field lock_rot_x number Freeze rotation about X (1/0).
---@field lock_rot_y number Freeze rotation about Y (1/0).
---@field lock_rot_z number Freeze rotation about Z (1/0).
---@field two_d number 2D: keep the body in the XY plane (1/0).

---A Point Light's live tunables.
---@class PointLightHandle
---@field intensity number Brightness multiplier.
---@field range number Reach in world units.
---@field r number Color red 0..1.
---@field g number Color green 0..1.
---@field b number Color blue 0..1.
---@field shape number The surface it emits from: 0 point, 1 sphere, 2 rect, 3 disk, 4 tube. Assigning keeps the size it had.
---@field width number Rect only: its width in world units (0 on other shapes).
---@field height number Rect only: its height in world units.
---@field radius number Sphere / disk only: its radius in world units.
---@field length number Tube only: how long the bar is.
---@field thickness number Tube only: how thick the bar is.
---@field twoSided number Rect / disk only (1/0): lights out of the back as well as the front.

---The scene's LIGHTING NODE (`find("Lighting"):getcomponent("Light")`) — the one
---environment a world has: the key light, the ambients, the shadows and the fog.
---Conventionally bound to `env`, because `light` is the Point Light handle.
---`ambient2dR/G/B` is where a 2D scene's brightness lives.
---@class LightHandle
---@field ambient2dR number The 2D BASE LIGHT, red 0..1 — the whole light a flat scene has before any 2D light is placed. White by default; turn it down for a dark room a torch can carve a circle out of, and read it back first so you can put it where it was.
---@field ambient2dG number The 2D base light, green 0..1. See ambient2dR.
---@field ambient2dB number The 2D base light, blue 0..1. See ambient2dR.
---@field intensity number Brightness multiplier on the key (directional) light.
---@field colorR number Key light colour red.
---@field colorG number Key light colour green.
---@field colorB number Key light colour blue.
---@field directionX number Key light direction X — lerp the three for a day cycle.
---@field directionY number Key light direction Y.
---@field directionZ number Key light direction Z.
---@field stars number Stars mode (1/0; assign true/false): luminous celestial bodies ARE the key lights.
---@field ambientR number 3D ambient fill red 0..1 — the fill under the key light, deliberately a different value from ambient2dR.
---@field ambientG number 3D ambient fill green 0..1.
---@field ambientB number 3D ambient fill blue 0..1.
---@field shadows number Sun shadows on (1/0; assign true/false). Every shadow field below only applies when this is on.
---@field shadowSoftness number 0 = razor-hard edge … 1 = dreamy-soft penumbra.
---@field shadowStrength number How dark full shadow gets, 0..1 (ambient still fills, so never pitch black).
---@field shadowTintR number Shadows darken toward this colour instead of black — red.
---@field shadowTintG number Shadow tint green.
---@field shadowTintB number Shadow tint blue.
---@field shadowQuantize number 0 = smooth penumbra; 2..8 = posterize it into that many bands (toon/retro).
---@field shadowDither number Bayer-dither the penumbra (1/0) — the classic PS1 dithered shadow edge.
---@field shadowDistance number Max world distance a shadow ray marches before giving up; far geometry stops casting past it.
---@field fog number Depth fog on (1/0; assign true/false).
---@field contactShadows number Contact shadows (1/0): the small dark line where things touch, traced from the depth buffer so a mesh casts its real silhouette. Only what is ON SCREEN casts one.
---@field contactLength number How far a contact shadow traces, in world units.
---@field contactSteps number Samples along the contact trace (2..32).
---@field contactStrength number How dark a contact shadow gets, 0..1.
---@field fogColorR number Fog colour red — match it to the horizon or a seam shows.
---@field fogColorG number Fog colour green.
---@field fogColorB number Fog colour blue.
---@field fogStart number World distance where fog begins (fully clear nearer than this).
---@field fogEnd number World distance where fog is full.
---@field fogDither number Dither the fog gradient to hide 8-bit banding on long ramps (1/0).
---@field fogDitherStrength number Dither amplitude 0..1.
---@field fogVolumetric number Volumetric mode (1/0): march real fog media instead of a distance ramp, so hills poke out of ground mist. fogStart/fogEnd do not apply.
---@field fogDensity number Volumetric: media density per world unit.
---@field fogHeight number Volumetric: world height (y) of the fog layer's top.
---@field fogFalloff number Volumetric: softness of the layer's top edge, world units.
---@field fogNoise number Volumetric: how much drifting noise breaks up the media, 0..1.
---@field fogNoiseScale number Volumetric: noise feature size, world units per repeat.
---@field fogLight number Volumetric: how much of the scene's light scatters in the fog (0 = a flat colour, 1 = lit by the sun/points/bounce, past 1 exaggerates).
---@field fogAnisotropy number Volumetric: which way the media throws light (-0.9..0.9, positive blooms toward the sun).
---@field fogSteps number Volumetric: samples along each pixel's fog ray (2..64).
---@field fogShafts number Volumetric (1/0): march the sun shadow per fog step — the beams, and the cost.

---A Camera's live properties (`node:getcomponent("Camera")`).
---@class CameraHandle
---@field fovY number Vertical field of view, radians.
---@field active number The play-mode view camera (1/0) — assign true to switch to it.

---A UI element's live properties (`node:getcomponent("UiElement")`) — drive a HUD
---from scripts. Position/size numbers follow whatever mode the Inspector set
---(px, %, grow); `text` content is `node.text`.
---@class UiElementHandle
---@field visible number Shown (1/0; assign true/false).
---@field opacity number Multiplies every color the element draws, 0..1.
---@field posX number Free position X / Pin offset X (design units).
---@field posY number Free position Y / Pin offset Y (design units).
---@field width number Width in the axis's sizing mode (px value, % fraction, or grow weight). Absent (nil) on a fit axis; writing one makes it fixed px.
---@field height number Height (same rules as width).
---@field radius number Shape corner radius (design units).
---@field border number Shape border thickness (design units).
---@field fillR number Shape fill red 0..1.
---@field fillG number Shape fill green 0..1.
---@field fillB number Shape fill blue 0..1.
---@field fillA number Shape fill alpha 0..1.
---@field textSize number Text glyph size (design units; ignored while fit is on).

---@field tintA number Image tint alpha 0..1.
---@field cell number Spritesheet cell index the image shows (set per frame for sprite animation).
---@field scrollY number Scroll-view position, design units (0 = top; the wheel drives it too, clamped to the content). Present only on elements with the scroll-view option.

---A UI slider's live value (`node:getcomponent("UiSlider")`) — the health-bar hook:
---`bar:getcomponent("UiSlider").value = hp` and the Fill/Handle parts follow.
---@class UiSliderHandle
---@field value number Current value (clamped to min..max at draw time).
---@field min number Range start.
---@field max number Range end.

---A UI layer's live properties (`node:getcomponent("UiLayer")`).
---@class UiLayerHandle
---@field enabled number Master switch (1/0; assign true/false) — an off layer draws nothing.
---@field z number Draw order: lowest z first.
---@field designHeight number Design units that span the window height.
---@field worldSpace number 1 = a panel inside the 3D world at this node's transform; 0 = a screen overlay.
---@field textSnap number Round every rasterized text size to a whole multiple of this many SCREEN PIXELS; 0 = off. For a pixel font whose art is a grid — a cell only looks like a pixel when it lands on a whole one.

---A Material's live SPRITESHEET frame (`node:getcomponent("Material")`) — the
---mesh-side twin of a UI image's cell. Slice the texture into a grid in its
---asset settings, then step the frame every tick:
---`face:getcomponent("Material").cell = math.floor(t * 8) % 16`.
---Everything else about a material goes through `node:setMaterial{...}`.
---@class MaterialHandle
---@field cell number Which cell of the sheet draws (row-major from the top-left; clamped into the grid).
---@field sheetCols number Sheet columns (0 = not a sheet — the whole texture).
---@field sheetRows number Sheet rows.

---A node's tilemap grid, from `node:tilemap()`. Read and write single squares
---to re-dress a room without rebuilding the node.
---
---`cell` is an index into the node's Material spritesheet. To clear a square,
---pass `-1` (any negative works, as in Tiled, Godot and LDtk), `nil`, or the
---`EMPTY_TILE` global — the three are the same value (`floptle/0083`).
---@class TilemapHandle
---@field EMPTY number The cell value meaning "no tile here". Same as the EMPTY_TILE global; -1 and nil mean it too.
---@field set fun(self: TilemapHandle, x: number, y: number, cell: number|nil, xform: table|nil) Set one square, 0-based from the TOP-LEFT. Outside the grid is a no-op, not a wrap. A negative or nil cell empties the square. The optional 4th argument turns it: { rot = 0|90|180|270, flipX = bool, flipY = bool }.
---@field get fun(self: TilemapHandle, x: number, y: number): number|nil The cell at (x, y), orientation stripped — nil outside the grid and on an empty square.
---@field at fun(self: TilemapHandle, x: number, y: number): number|nil, number|nil, boolean|nil cell, rot (degrees clockwise), flipX. The whole answer, for art that faces a direction.
---@field fill fun(self: TilemapHandle, cell: number|nil, xform: table|nil) Set every square, including the empty ones. No argument (or -1) clears the whole grid.
---@field fillRect fun(self: TilemapHandle, x0: number, y0: number, x1: number, y1: number, cell: number|nil, xform: table|nil) Fill a rectangle; corners in either order, clipped to the grid.
---@field size fun(self: TilemapHandle): number, number cols, rows.
---@field tileSize fun(self: TilemapHandle): number The world edge length of one square.
---@field resize fun(self: TilemapHandle, opts: table) tm:resize{ cols =, rows =, offsetX =, offsetY = } — keeps whatever overlaps. offsetX/Y is where the old top-left lands, so offsetY = 1 grows a row on top.
---@field cellAt fun(self: TilemapHandle, p: any): number|nil, number|nil Which square a WORLD position (vec3, {x=,y=,z=} or a node) falls in — through the map's own transform, so a moved, turned or scaled map still answers. nil off the map.
---@field worldAt fun(self: TilemapHandle, x: number, y: number): any|nil The world position of that square's CENTRE, or nil off the grid.
---@field tileset fun(self: TilemapHandle): string|nil The project-relative .tileset.ron this map is cut from, or nil.

---A node's Audio Source, controlled from a script via `node:sound()`.
---@class AudioSourceHandle
---@field play fun(self: AudioSourceHandle) Play the source's clip from the start (restarts if already playing).

---@field pause fun(self: AudioSourceHandle) Freeze playback (resume continues from here).
---@field resume fun(self: AudioSourceHandle) Continue a paused sound.
---@field setClip fun(self: AudioSourceHandle, clip: string) Swap the clip (project-relative path like "audio/steps.ogg"); restarts playback if playing.

---Something that walks the navmesh, returned by `nav.agent(node)`. Order it with

---@class NavAgentHandle
---@field state string 'idle' | 'moving' | 'arrived' | 'blocked' | 'crossing', and 'gone' once destroyed.
---@field arrived boolean True once it got there — the flag to hang "and then attack" off.
---@field moving boolean True while it still has somewhere to be.
---@field blocked boolean True when it cannot get there right now: unreachable, or no progress for giveUpAfter seconds. A crowd pin clears itself; a cut-off goal does not.
---@field offMesh boolean True when the order named a place the navmesh does not cover, rather than one it cannot reach.
---@field complete boolean Whether the route it is walking actually reaches the order.
---@field remaining number How far there is left to walk, ALONG THE ROUTE rather than through the walls.

---@field link string|nil The Nav Link being crossed right now, by name. The hook for a climb animation.
---@field linkProgress number|nil How far across that link, 0 to 1.
---@field alive boolean False once the agent (or its node) has gone.
---@field moveTo fun(self: NavAgentHandle, point: any) Send it to a world point. Idempotent, so calling it every frame to chase a moving target is fine.
---@field stop fun(self: NavAgentHandle) Cancel the order. Anything mid-crossing finishes crossing first.
---@field teleport fun(self: NavAgentHandle, point: any) Put it somewhere without walking there.
---@field set fun(self: NavAgentHandle, opts: table) Change how it walks mid-game; anything left out is left alone.
---@field corners fun(self: NavAgentHandle): table The corners still to walk, as a list of vec3.
---@field destroy fun(self: NavAgentHandle) Take it out of the crowd.

---A hole cut in the navmesh at runtime by `nav.obstacle(centre, size)` — the
---crate in the corridor. Keep the handle; `remove()` gives the ground back.
---@class NavObstacleHandle
---@field id number Its id in the mesh. Opaque; compare it, do not compute with it.
---@field active boolean Still cut out? False once removed, or after the scene reloaded.
---@field position Vec3|nil The middle of the hole ACTUALLY cut, in world space, or nil once removed.
---@field size Vec3|nil How big the hole actually is — the box you asked for, grown outward to whole navmesh cells. Draw this rather than what you passed in.
---@field remove fun(self: NavObstacleHandle): boolean Give the ground back. False if it was already gone — calling it twice is not an error.

---A playing sound returned by `audio.play(...)`. Handles stay valid until the

---@field setPan fun(self: SoundHandle, pan: number) Stereo pan −1..1 (non-spatial sounds).
---@field setTrack fun(self: SoundHandle, track: string) Re-route through a mixer track ("Master" or a track name).

---@field seek fun(self: SoundHandle, secs: number) Jump the playhead to a time in seconds.
---@field isPlaying fun(self: SoundHandle): boolean Still audible (false once finished)?
---@field position fun(self: SoundHandle): number Playhead in seconds.

---A mixer track handle from `audio.track(name)` — live control of the
---project mixer (reverts to the saved mixer when Play stops).
---@class AudioTrackHandle
---@field setVolume fun(self: AudioTrackHandle, db: number) Fader gain in dB (0 = unity, −60 = silent).
---@field setPan fun(self: AudioTrackHandle, pan: number) Stereo pan −1..1.
---@field setMuted fun(self: AudioTrackHandle, muted: boolean) Mute / unmute the track.

---@field endBehavior string? "Stop" (default) | "Destroy" (despawn the followed node) | "Loop".
---@field loop boolean? Shorthand for endBehavior = "Loop".

---The sound system: fire-and-forget playback + mixer control. Positions and
---following make it spatial; pass no position for flat 2D (UI, music).
---@class audio
---@field play fun(clip: string, a?: Node|number, b?: number|AudioPlayOpts, c?: number, opts?: AudioPlayOpts): SoundHandle Play a clip: `audio.play("audio/ding.ogg")` (flat) · `audio.play("audio/hit.ogg", x, y, z, opts)` (at a point) · `audio.play("audio/engine.ogg", carNode, {loop=true})` (follows the node).

---Spawn a PREFAB instance (make one by dragging a node into the Assets panel).
---`"bullet"` finds `prefabs/bullet.prefab.ron`; subfolder names and full
---paths work too. `pos` places the first root (a vec3/table/node); `fn(root)`

---Local-only in multiplayer — the server uses `net.spawn` for replicated objects.

function spawn(prefab, pos, fn) end

---Remove a node AND its whole subtree (physics body included). Queued —

---Runs once per frame AFTER physics and the interpolated transform writeback —

---UI button hook: fires when this node's UI element (with `button` on) is clicked

---@param node Node

---UI hook: the `UiCancel` action (Escape / B) while this element has focus.

---UI hook: a `draggable` element was picked up. The engine does NOT move it and
---draws no ghost — a card that tilts and an item that snaps to a grid are both

---the target `dragEnter` / `dragOver` / `dragLeave` / `dropped`.
---@param node Node
function dragStart(node) end

---UI hook: a completed drag. Fires on BOTH ends — the target that now has it and
---the source that gave it away. `ui.dragging()` / `ui.dropTarget()` name the pair.
---@param node Node
function dropped(node) end

---
---The handler is called `fn(element, hook)`, so one function can serve a whole

---Call it again when the data changes: only the difference is spawned and

--- ACTIONS ---------------------------------------------------------------
--- Named actions from Project Settings → Input. Prefer these over the raw

--- are what multiplayer replicates (raw polls read NEUTRAL on a Predicted
--- node, because the wire carries actions).

--- FIGHTER LAYER (fixedUpdate only) --------------------------------------

---The current numpad direction from the "Move" axis, written from the
---character's point of view (see input.setFacing):
---  7 8 9      up-back    up     up-forward

---@param facing number
function input.setFacing(facing) end
---@return number
function input.facing() end

--- LOCAL MULTIPLAYER ------------------------------------------------------

---The same input API bound to another local player (1-based). Two characters

---  local me = input.player(params.player)
---  if me.justPressed("Punch") then ... end
---@param n integer
---@return Input
function input.player(n) end

--- CONTEXTS + REBINDING (settings menus) ----------------------------------

---Push a named input layer. A `consume` layer swallows every action it doesn't

---  input.pushContext("menu", { priority = 100, consume = true, enabled = { "Pause" } })
---@param name string

---An action's bindings as printable chips (e.g. "⌨ Space", "🎮 South").
---@param name string
---@return string[]
function input.bindingsOf(name) end

---nil for any button. Escape always cancels rather than binding.
---@param name string
---@param filter string|nil
function input.startRebind(name, filter) end
---The captured binding's chip once something was pressed, "" while waiting,
---or nil when nothing is armed.

---that binding already existed.
---@return boolean
function input.commitRebind() end
function input.cancelRebind() end

---The active game camera's projection — turn a world point into a screen pixel
---(and back). The pixels are in the SAME space `input.mouse()` reports, so you
---can hover/click 3D things you drew: sample a line into points, project each,

---left.
---@return number, number, number, number
function camera.screenRect() end
---How many screen pixels one world unit covers.
---
---Under an ORTHOGRAPHIC camera the answer is the same everywhere and `distance`
---is ignored — that is what an orthographic projection means, and it is the case
---a flat game is in. Under a perspective one it is measured at `distance`,
---defaulting to the camera's distance from the origin.
---
---The number to size a pixel-art world by. A 2D camera can do the snapping for

---@param sx number
---@param sy number
---@return number, number, number, number, number, number

---Cast a ray against the world's colliders (terrain + meshes + primitives)
---AND every physics body (players, crates). Returns a hit table
---{x,y,z, nx,ny,nz, distance, node} or nil — `node` is the hit body's node
---handle (nil for static geometry), so `hit.node:getscript("combat")` works.
---Your OWN node's body is excluded (a ray from your center never hits you);
---pass another node as `ignore` to skip its body too (e.g. an orbit camera
---ignoring the character it follows). The last arg can instead be an OPTIONS
---table: `raycast(x,y,z, dx,dy,dz, max, { ignore = target, layers = {"Ground"} })`
---— `layers` (a name or an array of names, Project Settings → Layers) filters

---The player's accessibility settings (`floptle/0079`). A game's options menu

---@class Access
---@field textScale fun(): number The UI text multiplier (1.0 = normal).
---@field setTextScale fun(scale: number) Set the UI text multiplier, 0.5–3.0. Applied BEFORE layout, so text scaling reflows rather than clipping. Out of range raises.
---@field colorFilter fun(): string The active colour-vision filter: "none" / "protanopia" / "deuteranopia" / "tritanopia".
---@field setColorFilter fun(name: string, strength?: number) Correct the picture for a colour vision deficiency (a post-chain stage, so it applies to everything the player sees). An unrecognised name raises.

---@field filters fun(): { name: string, label: string }[] Every filter in menu order, for a settings dropdown.
---@field reducedMotion fun(): boolean The player asked for less movement — read this for YOUR camera shake and screen effects.
---@field setReducedMotion fun(on: boolean) Ask for less movement. The engine snaps its own UI transitions.
---@field captions fun(): boolean Is the player showing captions?
---@field setCaptions fun(on: boolean) Turn captions on.
