# Base building: the Engineer's Build Kit

This is the field version of the VAB. You stand in the world and the ground is
the craft: the same parts column, a ghost of the part under the cursor, and a
click to buy it, ship it out and set it down. This doc covers **deep-space
step 4**: addendum items K1–K4, K8, K13 and N1. Steps 5–8 (snapping, validity,
undo ring, deconstruct, stands, the tower, the base grid) build on the hooks
named at the end.

Read `docs/positions-and-frames.md` first. Everything here is kept in a body's
frame.

## 1. Who can build, and how it opens

- **The Build Kit** (`items.lua` `buildkit`) is a field tablet in a hard carry
  frame: 1.6 kg, 3 L, carried by its handle (grip `left`). It is a `device`, so
  it sits on the belt after the tools.
- **Issue.** Every Engineer gets one Build Kit, once per member.
  `field_builder.issue_tick` checks every 3 s and stamps
  `inv.issued.buildkit.<cid>`. That covers hires, retrains and old saves. It is
  not part of the standard `issue` (that goes to everyone), and it isn't sold
  yet. The Depot stocks it once the 10 % coverage unlock lands (M3, step 7).
- **The gate.** The kit opens only when all of these hold:
  - the active member is an Engineer (`crew.hasRole`, from the roles commit 578c13a);
  - they are on foot (`planet_walker.onFoot`) and not swimming;
  - no other panel is up (pause, pack, facility, ops board, map, lab talk);
  - the VAB doesn't have the keys;
  - the hands aren't at a job.
- **B or its number key** takes the kit out.
  - Non-Engineers have no kit, so B says "Build Kit: Engineers only".
  - With the kit up, **B** folds the parts column away and brings it back.
  - **Esc** drops the part in hand first; a second Esc closes the kit. Esc is
    on `pause_menu`'s ladder (`escTakenAt`).
  - **H**, or another number key, puts the kit away like any other item.
- **Free cursor.** While the kit is up, `planet_camera` leaves first person
  and shift-lock and won't scroll into first person. The cursor is then free.
  RMB held still looks round, and WASD still walks, so you can move, aim and
  place in one motion. Scroll still zooms the third-person view.

## 2. The parts column (K3)

- **`catalog_panel.lua`, re-hosted.** `field_builder` spawns a
  `FieldCatalogue` node under the Ship HUD while the kit is up and destroys it
  when the kit closes. A scene therefore holds one catalogue at most, either
  the VAB's or this one.
- **The host.** The panel finds its host with `host()`: the VAB's `builder`
  if it exists, otherwise `field_builder` while the kit is open.
  `field_builder` supplies the host methods: `catalogue`, `partInfo`, `hold`,
  `heldId`, `holding`, `dropHeld`, `previewPrefab`, `frameNodeOrNil`,
  `researchPending`, `hint`, `registerPanel`. It also supplies these optional
  hooks, all ignored by the VAB:
  - `cardLines(id, def, locked)` gives the price and role lines.
  - `noSubAssy` hides the SUB-ASSY tab.
  - `previewLayer()` names the layer the spinning preview and the card icons
    are photographed on. It is the VAB's own, `viewmodel`. The stand's frame
    is put inside the planet under the crew (2.4 km plus half the radius
    down), so the main camera can't see it. The studio cameras draw no
    terrain.
  - `layout(W, H)` places the column. It is the VAB's 228 px column, starting
    below the HUD's top-left chips.
  - `footText()` sets the footer line.
- **Kept from the VAB:** search (`/`), the tabs ALL · ★ · RECENT · BASE, the
  cards and the spinning preview plate.
- **Open:** in the world, the cards' 64 px icons (`camera.captureTexture`
  through the stand's icon camera) come back as plain sky. That happens on
  both the `offstage` and `viewmodel` layers, while the live render-target
  plate on the same stand draws the part. It is not yet known whether the VAB
  hits the same thing.
- **Hidden:** the toolbar, inspector, staging, symmetry and SUB-ASSY.
- **A card's lines** read `$1,040` and `$900 + $140 shipping · Pell Groundworks`.
  Off the home world they read `made here` and `needs materials + $180 fittings`.

### The BASE section (`scripts/parts_base.lua`)

| Part | Prefab | Real size | Mass | Price | Hull (EN1) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pad Plate | `BasePadPlate` | 4 × 4 m precast slab, 0.30 m | 11.5 t | $900 | none |
| Equipment Shed | `BaseShed` | 3.0 × 2.4 × 2.6 m steel shelter on skids | 1.6 t | $1,400 | `subShape`: its `Wall N` boxes |
| Surface Hab | `BaseHab` | 4 m × 6 m pressure can on saddles | 7.5 t | $6,500 | `shell`: its `Shell` child mesh |

- **Every BASE part is `fieldOnly`.** The VAB never lists them, because the
  builder doesn't extend its registry with `parts_base`. `register(REG,
  CATALOGUE)` is there for a shared catalogue one day.
- **`tools/gen_base_parts.py`** writes the models (`models/base/parts/`) and
  prefabs. They use the spaceport's primitives and its CC0/procedural PBR sets
  (`textures/base`: concrete, cladding, steel). The Build Kit's model uses
  `textures/parts` (metal, rubber).
- **Each module is built 1:1 with its future interior** (E's direction). The
  engine's interiors Stage 1 then becomes a flag change:
  - **Flat modules** (the shed) carry floor, walls, roof and door as named
    static collider boxes (`Wall N`). Each becomes one `rb.subShape`.
  - **Curved modules** (the hab) carry their pressure hull as one child mesh,
    `Shell` (`hab_shell.glb`). It is a 0.10 m wall with its inner face
    modelled, and it becomes the `rb.shell`. Until then an octagon of four
    collider boxes closes it.
  - **Both** carry their fit-out as an `Interior` child mesh: racks, bench,
    deck, bunks.
  - **Doors are closed.** Nobody walks inside a placed module before EN1/EN2,
    and there are no kinematic interior fakes.

## 3. The ghost and the aim (K4)

- **The aim.**
  - It is a ray through the cursor (`camera.screenToRay`), cast in
    `lateUpdate`. The Build Kit node is last in `system.ron`, so its
    `lateUpdate` runs after the camera has placed itself for the frame.
  - The ray hits terrain and colliders, at most 24 m from the Engineer.
  - The hit becomes a **pose** in its planet's frame at once:
    - the body-relative ground point;
    - up = the radial up;
    - the front (+Z) turned toward the Engineer.
  - The raw world hit is kept only for that frame's physics queries.
- **The ghost** is the part's own prefab, spawned once per pick:
  - with `spawn{ body = false }`, so it has no collider and costs physics
    nothing;
  - parented to the planet, so its local position is the body-relative pose
    plus its `seat`, written every frame;
  - turned into a hologram by **`ghost.apply(node, color, alpha)`**
    (`scripts/ghost.lua`), the one function Solar owns for this. EN10 changes
    only that function.
- **The Lua fallback for the ghost material:**
  - it is one material, `materials/hologram.ron` with `shaders/hologram.flsl`:
    additive rim and fill, untextured;
  - it is assigned once per node, then tinted with the `tint` and `alpha`
    uniforms;
  - a colour change costs two uniform writes. Nothing rebuilds a mesh or a
    material per frame.
- **Green means it can go there; red means it can't.** The reason shows on
  the hint line, which is `field_builder.hintLine()` (`items.lua` `hintFrom`).

### What step 4 judges (`field_builder.validity`)

- **Off the home world:** refused, with the reason (N2 comes at step 13).
- **Slope:** the ground normal against up must be at least the part's `slope`
  (0.95 for the slab, 0.96 for the shed, 0.97 for the hab: about 16° to 14° until step 5 lays foundations).
- **Not under water** (`climate.seaDepth`).
- **Not on the spaceport's paving** (`base_facilities.keepClear`).
- **Nothing in the way**, via **`placement.overlapObb(center, half, rot)`**
  (`scripts/placement.lua`). Its fallback until EN12:
  - it calls `overlapSphere` over the box's half-diagonal;
  - it then puts each hit's contact point, and the hit node's origin, through
    the builder's oriented-box signed distance (`builder_attach.boxSdf` in
    world axes);
  - the ground is skipped;
  - your own body names itself ("you're standing where it goes");
  - the result is cached while the ghost holds still (0.5 s, or a move over
    0.1 m).
- **Affordable:** `company.afford`.

## 4. Placing, money and shipping (K8, N1)

- **LMB places** a valid ghost (not over the column). The steps:
  1. `base_economy.quote` prices it: the part's price (the same REG cost the
     VAB charges at launch) plus **shipping at 10 % + $50**. Both are
     **charged at placement** (Q18) through `company.spend`, and the ledger
     says "… (shipped by Pell Groundworks)".
  2. A structure record is written.
  3. The part is spawned at once.
  4. The member is credited one `built` (crew levels count 20).
  5. A plain click empties the hand; **Shift+LMB** keeps a copy in hand.
- **RMB tapped** (under 0.25 s) drops the ghost.
- **Ctrl+Z** takes the last placement back if it is under 60 s old (Q18):
  - every dollar comes back, fee included, through `company.refund`;
  - a refund isn't income, so an advance takes no share;
  - the `built` credit is taken back.
  - After 60 s an undo is refused with "deconstruct it instead" (step 5).
- **The VAB still charges at launch, with no fee.** That's the agency's own yard.
- **The VAB's suppliers are already listed** (`base_economy.SUPPLIERS`), one
  per section, for step 13's part items: Marrow & Vance Propulsion, Teller
  Tankage, Halden Structural, Orbis Electrics, Kestrel Airframes, Burrow
  Automotive, Lindqvist Robotics, and Pell Groundworks for BASE.
- **Off the home world** (later steps), these rules are already written and
  tested:
  - fittings cost 20 % of the price (Q22);
  - a part is drawn from any container within 30 m, nearest first, the pack
    last (Q16, `containersInReach`).

## 5. Structures (K13, `scripts/structures.lua`)

A structure is a **blueprint at a pose**, kept in its body's frame:

```
struct.list, struct.seq
struct.<id> = { id, b = body, x, y, z (body-relative ground point), ux, uy, uz (up),
                fx, fy, fz (front = the parts' +Z), n, by, t (agency clock), d,
                bp = { { uid, id, x, y, z, yaw, pitch, roll, parent, att, sym, mir, stage } },
                st = { [uid] = {} }, paid = { cost, ship, total, t, supplier, by } }
```

- **`bp` is the builder's blueprint part shape.** It is in the structure's
  frame (+X right, +Y up, +Z front), at the part's ground point.
  `partPose(rec, p, seat)` adds the seat along up and turns by `yaw`.
- **Streaming:**
  - each part is spawned as a plain static prefab, parented to its planet, as
    the base facilities and deployables are;
  - parts spawn only while the focus is on that world or within 20 km of it,
    and unload beyond that;
  - the check runs once a second for all structures together.
- **Cost:** a placed part has no script and no moving body, so it costs
  nothing a tick (see the probe's numbers). Rendering is one prefab instance
  per part.
- **Reload:** the records are read again and the parts stand where they were,
  on a planet that has moved kilometres meanwhile (the probe checks this).

## 6. Tests and probes

- `luajit solar/tests/smoke_base_build.lua` runs 55 checks:
  - the BASE parts;
  - shipping, quotes and card lines;
  - the 60 s refund and Q16's reach order;
  - records, frames and poses, the save round-trip, ids never reused;
  - the Engineer gate on the real `crew.lua` (one kit, to the Engineer, once);
  - place → charge → record → credit, undo → refund, a refused spend that
    changes nothing, off-world refused;
  - the Build Kit on the belt.
- `tools/perf/buildkitprobe.sh <engine>` covers the whole flow in the engine.
  It does these, in order:
  1. the Pilot's B is refused, then the Engineer is issued a kit;
  2. B opens the kit and the column, and the card lines are checked;
  3. the Pad Plate ghost is checked green, with its foot on the ground every
     frame while the planet moves;
  4. it is placed ($1,040 charged, ledger checked) and Ctrl+Z refunds it;
  5. it is placed again with Shift held, a red ghost is shown over it, and a
     shed is placed beside it;
  6. Esc closes the kit; idle costs are measured;
  7. save and reload: both stand on their records, and a ray hits the shed's
     roof collider;
  8. pictures are taken from three cameras.

  Look for `BK PASS|FAIL` and `BK RESULT`.

## 7. Hooks for step 5 (K5–K7, K9–K10)

- **`field_builder.pose(hit)`** is the one place a hit becomes a pose. Step 5
  adds snapping to a structure's nodes (`builder_attach.candidates`), the
  0.5 m grid and yaw steps (`yawOffset` is already read), and Shift to free
  both.
- **`field_builder.validity(id, pose)`** is the one place a placement is
  judged. Step 5 adds foundations, flattening, crew in the footprint and the
  vein keep-out.
- **`field_builder.place(sid, partId, pose, payer)`** is pure-shaped (K12).
  `sid ~= nil` is where joining a structure goes: `structures.bp` is already a
  list.
- **The undo list** `{ sid, t }` (16 deep) is replaced by K9's
  `builder_history` ring. `base_economy.undoRefund` already says when an undo
  turns into a deconstruct (K10: price back, fee kept).
- **`placement.overlapObb`** becomes EN12's one call; `ghost.apply` becomes
  EN10's.
- **Machines and power (M6, N4):** a structure whose parts carry electronics
  becomes an anchored assembly with a 10 Hz power step. Static prefabs stay
  for slabs and sheds.
